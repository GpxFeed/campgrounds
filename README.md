The whole story is primarily intended for offline use on an old quad core netbook while traveling on the road beyond a usable or affordable Internet connection or in the Internet desert and and looking step by step for the next magic place to stay.

All pois have been extracted from OSM - OpenStreetMap - trimmed with the GpxPy parser together with other Python toolsets for optimal working with Cruiser Desktop :
